Capstone Team 8 "How does molecular phenotype influence tissue behavior"

# MS Model
Code adaptation of multicompartment tumor model for MS

# MulticompartmentTumors
Code for "Multicompartment modeling of protein shedding kinetics during vascularized tumor growth" 

Notes: 
- Create  spatial_figs folder to capture figures
- Proposed mathmatical expression for characterizing stress located in stress function file
- Use Jupyter notebook to execute "Run_Model" and "Stress Function" IPYNB Files
